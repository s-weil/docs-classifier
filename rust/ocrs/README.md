This crate contains the **ocrs** OCR engine as a library. See the
[main project README][main_readme] for general details about the project.

## Performance note

Make sure you build the `ocrs` crate and its `rten*` dependencies in **release
mode**. Debug builds of these crates will be extremely slow.
